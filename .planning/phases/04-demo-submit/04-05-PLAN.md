<objective>
Record the 2-minute demo video, complete the submission checklist, and submit to the hackathon portal.

Purpose: Close verification gap 2 — `demo/video.mp4` is missing and `demo/submission_checklist.md` is entirely unchecked. These are the final deliverables required for DEMO-02 and hackathon submission.
Output: Recorded demo video, completed checklist, and hackathon portal submission.

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Record the 2-minute demo video</action>
  <instructions>
This task requires human screen recording with voice-over — Claude cannot record video or audio.

**Follow the recording checklist at `demo/recording_checklist.md`:**

1. **Pre-flight:**
   - Open terminal in project root
   - Start screen recording software (OBS, QuickTime, or similar)
   - Have `demo/scenario.md` visible as a narration reference

2. **Record the demo (~2 minutes):**
   - Follow the timestamped narration in `demo/scenario.md` (0:00-2:00)
   - Run the demo command:
     ```bash
     .venv/bin/python demo/run_demo.py --mode live --store memory
     ```
   - If live mode fails (Azure not available), use mock fallback:
     ```bash
     python3 demo/run_demo.py --mode mock
     ```
   - Voice-over should highlight: failure detection -> analyzer findings -> diagnosis -> fix diff

3. **Export:**
   - Export recording as MP4
   - Save to `demo/video.mp4`
   - Verify file plays correctly

**When complete:** Type "recorded" and confirm `demo/video.mp4` exists.
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "recorded" when demo/video.mp4 is saved, or "skip" to proceed without video</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <action>Complete the submission checklist and submit to hackathon portal</action>
  <instructions>
This task requires human interaction with the hackathon submission portal — Claude cannot access external portals.

**Walk through `demo/submission_checklist.md` and check off each item:**

1. **Artifact Links section:**
   - Verify `README.md` exists and is complete
   - Verify `docs/architecture.png` exists (rendered in plan 04-04)
   - Verify `docs/architecture.mmd` exists as fallback
   - Verify `docs/failure_taxonomy.md` exists
   - Verify `demo/recording_checklist.md` exists

2. **Final Submission Requirements:**
   - Confirm `demo/video.mp4` exists (from previous task)
   - Confirm video shows the full failure -> fix flow
   - Confirm README has all required sections
   - Confirm architecture artifact is available
   - Confirm taxonomy is complete and linked from README
   - Confirm demo script matches recorded flow

3. **Submission Form Readiness:**
   - Finalize project title and description
   - Prepare repository link
   - Upload/link demo video
   - Reference supporting docs in submission notes
   - Confirm prize/category selections: AI Apps & Agents ($20k), Foundry ($10k), Multi-Agent ($10k)
   - **Submit!**

4. **Update checklist:** Edit `demo/submission_checklist.md` — change all `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for completed items.

**When complete:** Type "submitted" to confirm portal submission is done.
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Type "submitted" when hackathon portal submission is complete, or describe what's blocking</resume-signal>
</task>

<success_criteria>
The hackathon submission is complete: demo video recorded, all checklist items verified, and project submitted to the portal. This closes VERIFICATION gap 2 (DEMO-02) and completes Phase 4.
</success_criteria>
